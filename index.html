              <p><h3>Hi, I'm Emma Carr</h3>
               
                <p>I'm a flex engineering student located in sunny Jacksonville, <a href="https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/florida/facts-fl/">Florida</a>.</p>
                <p>Outside of my studies, I work with 8th grade students at a local middle school. My goal is to turn my gardening passion into a communial suburban farming practice to help raise awareness for fresh food shortages and subsistance living.</p>

            </header>
            <p>While my passion for tech has always existed, I most enjoy sharing this experience with students.
                <p>
                In 2014 I moved to Phnom Pehn, Cambodia to teach at an international school focused on teaching students <strong>21st Century Skills</strong>. </p>
                <br>Skills such as:
                <br><ul>
                    <li>Technology</li>
                    <li>Information</li>
                    <li>Communication</li>
                    <li>Collaboration</li>
                    <li>Creativity</li>
                    <li>Critical Thinking</li>
                    <li>and Problem-solving</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Do these look familiar? Many of these skills are mentioned in the Thinkful curriculum as being essential to a role within the industry.</p>
              <p>After years abroad, both learning and teaching the importance of digital literacy in the 21st century, I have left the traditional role of education to work with like-minded individuals, focused on ways to improve student lives through software development.</p>
